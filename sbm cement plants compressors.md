Air compressor Wikipedia An air compressor is a device that converts power into potential energy stored in pressurized air (i.e.compressed air).By one of several methods,an air compressor forces more and more air into a storage tank,increasing the pressure.When tank pressure reaches its upper limit the air compressor shuts off. Proven in tough industrial applications Cement Lime Gypsum The production of oil free compressed air with a maximum pressure of between 1.0 and 1.5 bar was previously a tricky subject because it was not possible to achieve such high pressures with blowers.The use of screw compressors as an alternative was a cost intensive solution for this pressure range,because this type of&nbsp;.
