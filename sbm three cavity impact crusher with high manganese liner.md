sbm three cavity impact crusher with high manganese linerImpact crusher,Impact crusher for sale,PF impact crusher. Impact crusher is widely used for crushing stone in mining,highway,railway,construction,etc.It is an irreplaceable crushing equipment for high grade sand and gravel.Working VSI PARTS • CRUSHER PARTS Our Material: High Chromium,High Manganese and Tungsten carbide.The Vertical shaft impact crusher wear parts are contained both within and on the outer surfaces of the rotor.Different wear parts have different material technology to resist either impact or abrasive wear. Description on the Counterattack Liner of Impact Crusher. If the costumers want to select a high efficiency impact crusher,it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding on the counterattack liner of impact crusher.In this paper,Hongxing Machinery will introduce the relevant knowledge of impact crusher's impact liner to clients.1.Working principle of the impact crusher liner plate Impact crusher The NIle Machinery Co.Ltd Impact crusher is a crushing machine which uses the impact energy to break the material.When working,the rotor rotates at high speed driven by the motor,and when the material enters the crushing cavities,it will be broken into pieces with the plate hammer on the rotor and thrown on the impact liner to break again. Manganese steel wear liners — Sandvik Mining and Rock. Austenitic manganese steel steel alloyed with more than 10% manganese is work hardening.That means that high impacts like those in a crushing chamber for example cause the formation of a extremely hard surface layer that is two to three times harder than the rest of the alloy If impacted enough,this results in a hard exterior layer backed by a softer core.
