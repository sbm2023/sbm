Continuous casting Wikipedia Continuous casting,also called strand casting,is the process whereby molten metal is solidified into a &quot;semifinished&quot; billet,bloom,or slab for subsequent rolling in the finishing mills.Prior to the introduction of continuous casting in the 1950s,steel was poured into stationary molds to form ingots.Since then,&quot;continuous&nbsp;. Water slag grinding equipment Clirik Basalt grinding mill,Stone. Putting the melt slag into water,after water cooling the final product is water granulated slag,mainly slag bath water quenching and stokehole water quenching two ways.Water granulated slag as building material is use to product cement and concrete.Because of water granulated slag&#39;s potential water hard gel&nbsp;. Slag Metals Sorting : Tomra Sorting algorithms can be varied easily,to separate different types of slag and or metal.The flexible modular design also allows plants to be mobile and means the system can dovetail with others to create a complete turnkey line.Sensor based sorting is also completely dry,requiring no water or expensive water treatment&nbsp;. Electroslag welding Wikipedia The wire and tube then move up along the workpiece while a copper retaining shoe that was put into place before starting (can be water cooled if desired) is used to keep the weld between the plates that are being welded.Electroslag welding is used mainly to join low carbon steel plates and or sections that are very thick.
