Pol fibre imbibition reduced mill loss,novel concept. The Noel Deerr formula for reduced [12.5% fibre basis] mill extraction has often been improved by introducing the factor √6p (1 f),where p = pol in cane and f = fibre in cane; the formula obtained gives unconvincing results if p or f is high,and inaccurately reflects the effect of imbibition.It is recommended that the above factor be replaced by √6p (1 f p),which accounts for both.
