A Review of the Flotation of Copper Minerals ResearchGate Flotation Reagents.Reagents are the most important part of the flotation process [7].The selection of reagents is of great importance for the process to give the most effective separation and concentration results.The authors of [40] reported that sodium sulphide and butyl xanthate flotation obtained a concentrate with. optimisation of the froth flotation process of chingola refractory ores flotation process.This would ensure that the process will recover both the copper oxide and sulphide minerals,thus,increasing the total copper obtained in the final concentrate.However,the sulphidisation.Zhan fang et al,(2009) reported that sodium sulphide and butyl xanthate flotation obtained a concentrate with&nbsp;. sodium butyl xanthate Florrea SBX(Sodium N Butyl Xanthate) is also used in flotation of nickel ores,especially for the flotation treatment of Cu Ni compound sulfide ore as well as gold mine associated with pyrite.It can also get satisfactory results when used in lead oxide copper ores.Commonly used in the process of rough flotation and&nbsp;. Sodium Ethyl Xanthate 3DChem.com They can form ethyl,butyl (isobutyl,normal butyl,secondary butyl),propyl (isopropyl,normal propyl) and amyl (isoamyl,normal amyl,secondary amyl) xanthates,in dry forms,such as powder,granules,pellets,tablets or flakes.Xanthate is the common name for chemical reagents used in the flotation of base and precious&nbsp;. Evaluation of sodium isobutyl xanthate as a collector in the froth. The dosage of a collector is an important factor that determines the efficiency of a froth flotation process.The representative sample of the carbonatitic Palabora copper ore ground 45 % passing 75 µm was froth floated with sodium isobutyl xanthate (SIBX) collector at 60,70,80,90 and 100 g t dosages.The concentrates and&nbsp;.
