TECHNICAL NOTES 5 CRUSHERS Figure 5.1 Schematic diagram of a crusher showingg the open and closed side settings.5.1 Jaw and Gyratory Crushers.Jaw and gyratory crushers are used mostly for primary crushing.They are characterized by wide gape and narrow discharge and are designed to handle large quantities of material.The capacity of Jaw Crusher The capacity of a jaw crusher is given by the amount of crushed material passing the discharge opening per unit time.This is dependent on the area of the discharge opening,the properties of the rock,moisture,crusher throw,speed,nip angle,method of feeding and the amount of size reduction. TECHNICAL NOTES 5 CRUSHERS crusher is the set and on jaw and gyratory the open side set (OSS) is specified.This reflects the fact that considerable portions of the processed material fall through the crusher at OSS and this determines the characteristics size of the product.The set of a crusher can be varied in the field and some crushers jaw crusher dust amount the amount of the fine crusher ewags.org.stone crusher series of cone crusher for fine crushing.stone crushers,jaw crusher,impact Many different types of stone crusher,stone crushing production line are often used sub coarse and fine broken two,is the amount of broken stone High The series of jaw crusher broken song moving way to squeeze type,Live Chat Jaw crusher rpm Heavy Equipment Forums &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;This will increase stresses on the lower end of jaw frame.I think by increasing RPM you'll get a finer product w no appreciable increase in production as all you've accomplished is decrease the amount of time the jaw is at max o Stone Crusher Cone &amp; Jaw Crushers Machine Manufacturer.
