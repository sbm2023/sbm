sbm south stream conveyor beltAlarm over dramatic weakening of Gulf Stream Environment The. 1 Dec 2005.The current is essentially a huge oceanic conveyor belt that transports heat from equatorial regions towards the Arctic circle.Warm surface water coming up from the tropics gives off heat as it moves north until eventually,it cools so much in northern waters that it sinks and circulates back to the south. Climate change may shut down a current that keeps the North. 6 Jan 2017.New research suggests this conveyer belt of warmth could be more fragile than we thought.The current is called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and it&#39;s like a conveyer belt that brings warm water from the tropics to the the cooler.AMOC in the North and South Atlantic oceans. New Simulations Question the Gulf Stream&#39;s Role in Tempering. Three new climate studies indicate that our long held belief about the Gulf Stream&#39;s role in tempering Europe&#39;s winters may not be correct.These shallow and deep currents link to form something of a conveyor belt by the sinking,or downwelling,of surface waters at high latitudes in the Labrador and Nordic seas and by&nbsp;.
