Gold extraction Wikipedia Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining&nbsp;. Scorpio Gold Corporation Mineral Ridge Sun Dec 3,2017 Prior to Scorpio Gold&#39;s acquisition in March 2010,Mineral Ridge historically produced ~575,000 ounces of gold,including ~170,000 ounces from open pit and ~405,000 ounces from underground mining operations.Upon acquiring its interest,the Company commenced major site rehabilitation to bring the project to a fully&nbsp;. Gold Minerals Education Coalition South Africa is the world&#39;s largest producer of gold and is estimated to have half of these gold resources.The United States and Brazil each have significant amounts of the world&#39;s gold resources.Approximately one fifth of the total resources of gold in the world are by products from copper and silver ore processing.

Sulphide Gold Gekko Because cyanide cannot always leach sulphide associated gold,regrinding the ore is typically required to expose the free gold for recovery by intensive leaching.Critically,the size at which one can efficiently liberate gold from the host mineral of the particle will determine the process to use for optimal gold recovery.
