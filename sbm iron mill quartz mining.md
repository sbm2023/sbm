sbm iron mill quartz miningStamp Mills for Processing Gold Silver Copper Ore Stamp mills are used by miners to crush valuable ore and extract the metals within them.Gold,silver,and copper are common metals that are found within ore,and stamp mills allow these metals to be released from rock for further processing and refining. Iron ore Mining of banded iron formations involves coarse crushing and screening,followed by rough crushing and fine grinding to comminute the ore to the point where the crystallized magnetite and quartz are fine enough that the quartz is left behind when the resultant powder is passed under a magnetic separator.
