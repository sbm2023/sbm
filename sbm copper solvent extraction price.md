Literature reveals that this extractant was extensively used for copper extraction.8 12.Price and Reid13 described the separation of nickel from cobalt,both present as amines,using modified LIX 84 I.In this paper,we report on the solvent extraction of nickel(II) from sulfate solutions using LIX 84I as the extractant.The. Investigation of Copper Extraction from Aqueous Sulfate Solution in. In view of the industrial and economic importance of this metal,there is a great need to separate and recover copper ions using cost effective commercial extractants.Literature review indicates that hydroxyoximes are now used widely as extractants for copper SX in hydrometallurgy marketed as LIX (Cognis),Acorga (ICI) or&nbsp;. Growing role of solvent extraction in copper ores processing (PDF. Heap leaching of oxide copper ores and cathode copper recovery by solvent extraction (SX) and elec trowinning (EW) has been well established as a primary low cost hydrometallurgical copper recovery method.Subsequently,hydrometallurgy was also gradually developed and applied for sulphidic ores and concentrates.
