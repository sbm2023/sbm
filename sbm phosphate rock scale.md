Phosphate Wikipedia A phosphate (PO3− 4) is an inorganic chemical and a salt forming anion of phosphoric acid.In organic chemistry,a phosphate,or organophosphate,is an ester of phosphoric acid.Of the various phosphoric acids and phosphates,organic phosphates are important in biochemistry and biogeochemistry,also called ecology,&nbsp;. Phosphate mining in the United States Wikipedia In 2015,27.6 million metric tons of marketable phosphate rock,or phosphorite,was mined in the United States,making the US the world&#39;s third largest producer,after China and Morocco.The phosphate mining industry employed 2,200 people.The value of phosphate rock mined was US$2.2 billion.As of 2015,there are 10&nbsp;. Risks and Opportunities in the Global Phosphate Rock Market (see section 2.3).The figure shows that phosphate rock prices have been prone to sudden shocks.This is particularly problematic for countries heavily reliant on imports,such as Member States of the EU.There is also a heightened risk for small scale farmers,who are disproportionately affected by even small changes. Peak Phosphorus Yet there are no alternatives to phosphate rock currently on the market that could replace it at any significant scale.While various small scale trials are being undertaken,commercialisation and implementation on a global scale could take decades to develop (see e.g.struvite precipitation).Phosphorus Resources. Peak Phosphorus: the sequel to Peak Oil Phosphorus Futures Like oil in the 1970&#39;s,phosphate rock is experiencing it&#39;s first significant price shock a 700% increase from US$50 tonne to US$350 tonne in just 14 months (Lewis,2008).Yet there are no alternatives to phosphate rock currently on the market that could replace it at any significant scale.While various small scale trials are&nbsp;. Phosphorus Supply and Demand MIT Today,however,large scale agriculture in the wake of the green revolution demands focused,synthetic fertilizers to provide the nutrients for higher yield crops.Approximately 191 Mt (megatons = millions of tons) of phosphate rock were mined last year,and the USGS estimates global phosphate reserves at 71,000 Mt&nbsp;.
