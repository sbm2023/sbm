Presentation 1 Mill (Grinding) Industrial Processes Tumbling Mills : BALL MILL Jana Marie D.Gomonid Grinding is the last stage in the process of comminution.The reduction ratio is usually large (8 to 25:1 sometimes 500:1).Grinding Mills are generally classified into two types: tumbling mills and stirred mills.In Tumbling Mills: Mill shell Metso Ball Mills Ball mills operate either in open or closed circuit.Open circuit operation is best utilized when: • Another stage of grinding follows the mill • Reduction ratio is small • Feed material is already fine and one pass through the mill produces the desired results • Product size control is not critical and oversize material can be Cryogenic Grinding &amp; Attritors Attritors can generally grind to finer size particle size range than impact or hammer mills by combining the advantages of cryogenic temperatures with both impact and shear forces inherent to high energy internally agitated ball mills.Cryogenic grinding is most effective when the product is sprayed with liquid nitrogen as it is being conveyed.
