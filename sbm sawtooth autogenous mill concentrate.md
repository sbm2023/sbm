Optimizing Grinding Circuits Optimizing Grinding Circuits Abstract.Grinding is carried out in a fully autogenous (AG) mill.The mill operates in closed circuit with a pebble crusher.Throughput is approximately 380 tph.Cyclone overflow from the.concentrate is transported by road to a rail receiving station. Autogenous mill Britannica Other articles where Autogenous mill is discussed: mineral processing: Grinding: Autogenous mills operate without grinding bodies; instead,the coarser part of the ore simply grinds itself and the smaller fractions.To semiautogenous mills (which have become widespread),5 to 10 percent grinding bodies (usually metal spheres) are added. Utah International Island Copper Complex,Canada Island Copper's six autogenous grinding mills,each 32 feet in diameter and 14 feet in length,comprised the largest totally autogenous grinding circuit in the copper industry at the time.The grinding mills convert the ore into approximately 230,000 tons annually of copper concentrate and 1,800 tons of molybdenum concentrate.
