Electroless nickel and immersion gold (ENIG) plating is one of the common pad metallurgical surface finish for area array packages and printed circuit boar. Electroless nickel immersion gold Wikipedia Electroless nickel immersion gold (ENIG) is a type of surface plating used for printed circuit boards.It consists of an electroless nickel plating covered with a thin layer of immersion gold,which protects the nickel from oxidation.ENIG has several advantages over more conventional (and cheaper) surface platings such as&nbsp;. Galvano Hengelo,electroless gold Electroless gold.Galvano Hengelo uses a so called “immersion gold” process for electroless gold coatings,therefore the coating is also indicated as an immersion gold coating.Parts can be plated with a maximum of 0.12 microns pure gold over a base coat of (electroless) nickel.This technique is mainly used to prevent&nbsp;. Gold plating for edge connectors Eurocircuits 1 Nov 2012.Gold plating over edge connectors.Eurocircuits offer two types of gold finish: Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold (ENIG) as a surface finish for the whole PCB,and hard plated gold over plated nickel for edge connector fingers.Electroless gold gives excellent solderability,but the chemical deposition process&nbsp;. Root Cause of Black Pad Failure of Solder Joints with Electroless. Abstract: Publications on the so called black pad defect,seen in electroless nickel immersion gold (ENIG) surface finishes,often cite high phosphorous (P) content in the nickel (Ni) plating as a key factor in the defect.Therefore,one proposed solution is to decrease the P content in the electroless Ni plating.In a contrary&nbsp;. ENIG vs Flash Gold SMTnet Flash gold is electrolytic gold where the panel is connected to a plating rectifier and current causes the plating process to occur.Gold thickness is controlled by time in the bath and current density.Flash gold will become thick gold if time in the bath goes too long.Immersion gold is gold plating over&nbsp;. Corrosion behavior of electroless nickel immersion gold plating by. Pad discoloration is caused by Ni corrosion during electroless nickel immersion gold (ENIG) treatment,and here it was investigated by SEM,XPS and cross sectional EDS analysis.Interestingly,we found that the corrosion occurred at two different sites.For relatively thinner Ni layers,the Ni corrosion occurred at the nodule&nbsp;.
