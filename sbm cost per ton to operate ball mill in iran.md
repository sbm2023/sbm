sbm cost per ton to operate ball mill in iranPDF (1044 K) Journal of Mining and Environment energy at SAG and ball mills to produce one ton of final product was 23.16 kWh t and 36.05 kWh t respectively.Thus,the ball mill.dimensional model provided the possibility of calculation of liner weight and volume at each stage of operation [4].Considering this modeling,abrasion rates were calculated with high accuracy. Grinding Balls and Other Grinding Media: Key consumables &amp;dash. 28 Oct 2015.Grinding balls form the major portion of the consumable costs.They can account for 40% 45% of the total cost and directly affect a mill&#39;s efficiency and wear and tear.The ball charge consists of grinding balls of several sizes and of different material qualities.Poor quality grinding media balls have a&nbsp;.
