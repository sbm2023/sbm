Optimising fuel flow in pulverised coal and biomass fired boilers Before fuel is introduced,a clean air test should be conducted to balance the system resistance of each burner line leaving each mill,ideally to within ±2% of the mean (Storm 2009).Ideally,coal flow balancing should be based on dirty air flow measurement which is more representative of the actual flow conditions than the&nbsp;. Coal Fired Power Plant Heat Rate Reductions EPA 22 Jan 2009.The improvement in combustion reduces the amount of coal that must be transported and burned in the boiler and thereby reduces fuel cost and the plant heat rate.Improvements to pulverizer designs have enabled more finely ground coal and a lower primary air pressure drop through the pulverizer.Ref.
