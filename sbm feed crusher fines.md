Cone Crusher The gyratory crusher has capacities starting from 1200 to above 5000 t h.To have a feed opening corresponding to that of a jaw crusher,the primary gyratory crusher must be much taller and heavier.Therefore,primary gyratories require quite a massive foundation.The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. 5 Aggregate Production As with other compression crushers,the cone crusher yields a somewhat elongated and slivery particle shape.This may be minimized,however,by &quot;choke&quot; feeding the crusher.This technique will also make the shape and size more uniform.One way to choke feed is with a surge hopper and a controlled belt feed to the cone crusher (Figure 5 10). Screening Crusher Feed The feed to a crusher should not contain an excessive amount of fine material; this could be stated a little more definitely by saying that it should not contain an excessive amount of material smaller than the crusher product size.Just what constitutes an ‚Äúexcessive amount‚Äù depends of course upon several factors,chief among which are the design of the crushing chamber,the ‚Ä¶
