Extraction Process US Oil Sands US Oil Sands&#39; proprietary extraction process is a breakthrough in oil sands extraction.Surface oil sand is mined and crushed for size reduction; Hot water at 50 80oC is added to the crushed oil sand to allow the heavy bitumen to become less.This accelerates the settling of the impurities by gravity or centrifugation. Basics in Minerals Processing Metso Crushing and screening is the first controlled size reduction stage in the process.This is the main process in aggregate production and a preparation process for further size reduction.Grinding is the stage of size reduction (wet or dry) where the liberation size for individual minerals can be reached.By further size reduction&nbsp;.
