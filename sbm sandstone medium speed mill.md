Material Cutting Speeds For Milling operations speeds may be increased by 50%.Lathe turning speeds may be increased by 100%.The best rule of thumb for proper cutting speed is the color of the chip when cutting steel.Using a high speed steel drill bit the chips should never be turning brown or blue. Millstone Millstones for some water powered mills (such as Peirce Mill) spin at about 125 rpm.Especially in the case of wind powered mills the turning speed can be irregular.Higher speed means more grain is fed to the stones by the feed shoe,and grain exits the stones more quickly because of thei Speeds and feeds Milling cutter paused after taking a cut.Arrows show the vectors of various velocities collectively known as speeds and feeds.The circular arrow represents the angular velocity of the spindle (rev min),called the &quot;spindle speed&quot; by machinists.
