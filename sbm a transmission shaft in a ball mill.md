sbm a transmission shaft in a ball millBall mill Wikipedia Industrial ball mills can operate continuously,fed at one end and discharged at the other end.Large to medium sized ball mills are mechanically rotated on their axis,but small ones normally consist of a cylindrical capped container that sits on two drive shafts (pulleys and belts are used to transmit rotary motion).A rock&nbsp;. Function Principle Zoz GmbH The principle of rotary ball mills is that energy is transferred from outside (drive) by a drive shaft into a grinding vessel and here by a rotor and grinding media finally into powder material (e.g.pre crushed or atomised).During contact between balls,rotor and vessel the powder particles get stressed by a force which leads to&nbsp;.
