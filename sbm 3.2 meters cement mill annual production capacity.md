CEMENT JANUARY 2017 For updated information,please visit www.ibef.org 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Second largest cement market • With cement production capacity of nearly 366 million tonnes,as of 2015,India was the second largest cement producer in the world.In 2016,country’scement production HeidelbergCement expands its cement capacity in Liberia. In Liberia,HeidelbergCement has successfully commissioned a new cement mill at its cement grinding plant in the capital city of Monrovia.The investment in the new mill,which has an annual capacity of 0.5 million tonnes,amounted to US$ 14 million. Cement kiln Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement,in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silicates.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year,and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually defines the capa Hebei should withdraw from steel production capacity of 14. &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Specifically,by the end of December this year,Tianjin closed one blast furnace of 588 cubic meters of Rongcheng Iron and Steel; Hebei Province reduced steel production capacity of 14 million tons,coke production capacity of 3 million tons,cement production capacity Kenya's Bamburi Cement says to increase grinding capacity. &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Kenya's Bamburi said it plans to increase its cement grinding capacity by 900,000 tonnes at one of its two plants by mid 2018 and lift total annual production capacity to 3.2 million tonnes.
