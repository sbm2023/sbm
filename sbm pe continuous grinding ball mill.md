Design considerations for large diameter ball mills. Large mill (D&gt;5.0 m (16.5 ft)) performance has been successfully predicted from small scale batch experiment for grinding kinetics and an RTD correlation for transport using population balance models.The effect of ball size must be properly taken into account in the scale up.A design method that combined the kinetic scale up findings and the transport of material through the mill has been. Variable Speed Rotor Mill PULVERISETTE 14 classic line. Effective comminution due to highest rotor speed The FRITSCH Variable Speed Rotor Mill PULVERISETTE 14 classic line is the ideal mill for fast,effective comminution of soft to medium hard,brittle and fibrous materials as well as temperature sensitive samples proven worldwide for the use in trace analysis.
