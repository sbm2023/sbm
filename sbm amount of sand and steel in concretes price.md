How to calculate materials for different ratio concrete A Civil Engineer 5 Mar 2013.Now lets estimate the required materials for the volume of 100 cft concrete of 1:1.5:3 ratio: Wet volume of concrete = 100 cft.Dry volume of concrete= 100 x 1.54 = 154 cft.Sum of ratio 1:1.5:3,1 + 1.5 + 3 = 5.5.So,Cement content in concrete = (154 5.5) x 1=28 cft.Sand content= (154 5.5) x 1.5 = 42 cft.
