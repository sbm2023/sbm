Failure and sensitivity analysis of a reconfigurable vibrating screen. There were numerous root causes of failures on vibrating screens that were identified during the industrial investigation as outlined in the fish bone diagram depicted in Fig.2.The root causes were classified into four categories (people,product,process and equipment) that are known as contributors to the failures. Gyratory equipment Wikipedia Gyratory equipment,used in mechanical screening and sieving is based on a circular motion of the machine.Unlike other methods,gyratory screen operates in a gentler manner and is more suited to handle fragile things,enabling it to produce finer products.This method is applicable for both wet and dry screening. Screens,Sieves &amp; Vibrating Separators Gough Engineering Vibratory Sieves,Screens &amp; Separators offer efficient and accurate screening and separation of a wide array of products.The systems typically use meshes or perforated plates to give an aperture that separates based on particle size.The vibration is generated by an &#39;out of balance&#39; vibratory motor.The motors are set up&nbsp;.
