Metso the sharpness of the product size distribution curve produced from milling (Figure 3).Crusher rod milling circuits have been superceded largely by SAG and autogenous grinding (AG) mills,which enable greater tonnage rates.SAG AG mills are similar to ball mills in that breakage largely occurs due to the tumbling action of. Mills suitable for the crushing and pulverisation of inert materials.
