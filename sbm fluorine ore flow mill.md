Mineralogical and Metallurgical Examination of. high abundance of fluorine (January and November) at 4.2 per cent F average.The months of high fluorine,however,do not translate to high skarn ore in feed as noted by Lauder (1997).In July 1996,skarn ore forms of how fluorine is used today Chemistry for Kids: Elements Fluorine Ducksters.How is fluorine used today? Fluorine is rarely used in its pure form,but many compounds of fluorine are used by industry One of the most popular applications of fluorine is for University of Minnesota’s Mineral Pages: Fluorite The name ‘fluorite’ comes from the Latin word ‘fluere’ that means “to flow.” Fluorite melts easily and is used as a flux in the smelting of metallic ores.A ‘flux’ is a material used to help remove impurities from ore as it is refined into metal. ASARCO &#187; Milling The ore is ground into a fine powder by large rotating mills.The two types used in the Mission South Mill are called SAG (semi autogenous grinding) mills and ball mills.SAG mills use larger pieces of ore to break up the smaller pieces (autogenous — does it by itself).The larger pieces break down as well. Uranium processing After mining,uranium ore is transported to a nearby mill for processing.The first step is to crush the ore and mix it with water so that it can move through a series of mill circuits.After crushing,the ore is treated with acid in large tanks,to separate the uranium from other minerals in the rock.
