sbm jaw crushers shaftsimage for jaw crusher shafts Jaw Crushers,Single Toggle Crusher,Double Toggle Crushers,Know More.Jaw crushers process medium to hard quarry rock or other materials by compressing it between the fixed jaw and the swing jaw The swing jaw being the moving part is attached to a rotating eccentric shaft The fixed jaw is an integral part of the crusher frame Both jaws are fitted with manganese jaw liners that can be. Jaw Crusher The gyratory crusher can,just like a jaw crusher,accept boulder sizes close to 1.5 m (for the largest equipment). This crusher can handle products with a Mohs hardness that is not necessarily less than 5. As is the case for jaw crushers,there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces,but simply rolling of the nut on concaves. What is a Jaw Crusher and How Does it Work? &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Double toggle jaw crushers.In a double toggle jaw crusher,the moving crusher jaw is driven by the eccentric shaft that moves the front and rear toggles up and down.Each shaft revolution causes the moving crusher jaw to close at the downstroke and open up during the upstroke. Crusher The Blake crusher was patented by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858.The Blake type jaw crusher has a fixed feed area and a variable discharge area.Blake crushers are of two types single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers.In the single toggle jaw crushers,the swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft which leads to a much more compact design.
