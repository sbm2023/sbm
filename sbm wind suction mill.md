Comet Windmill Products &amp; Services Comet Windmills. Comet Windmill Products &amp; Services; The Comet Windmill is a direct acting windmill which means the power of the wind works directly onto the pump through the up and down stroke created by the revolution of the wheel.In addition,the pumping power is increased due to fewer working parts than other windmills that lose power through friction.
