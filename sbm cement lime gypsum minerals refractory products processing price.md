Cement Wikipedia The chemical reaction results in mineral hydrates that are not very water soluble and so are quite durable in water and safe from chemical attack.This allows setting in wet condition or underwater and further protects the hardened material from chemical attack.The chemical process for hydraulic cement found by ancient&nbsp;. Strength development in concrete Understanding Cement Overview of concrete setting,hardenening and strength development.Hardening is the process of strength growth and may continue for weeks or months after the concrete has been mixed and placed.Some minerals,gypsum for example,can grind preferentially producing a cement with a high surface area.Such a&nbsp;. Latest trends in refractory materials Cement Lime Gypsum Refractories are indispensable for high temperature industrial processes.Their raw materials are minerals with high melting points,such as magnesite,dolomite and aluminum silicate.The global refractory market exceeds 20 € bn.Roughly 8 %,(1.6 € bn) is used by the cement industry (Figure 1).The largest consumer is&nbsp;. Trends and developments in green cement and concrete technology. Products such as GGBS or fly ash can be used to substitute clinker in cement production either before (limited by the low lime content of the additives) or after calcination (OECD IEA and World Business Council for Sustainable Development,2009),however,there are limitations to this process such as availability or cost of&nbsp;.
