Spatial vibration of rolling mills The analysis of rolling mill vibrations is usually limited to simple planar or low DOF vibrations.In reality,however,rolling mill vibrations take place in six DOF leading to spatial behaviors involving vertical,horizontal,axial,reverse,cross and swinging vibration modes resulting in complex relative motions between the rolls. Section 5,Misalignment Vibration at 1 x rpm of Rotor In fact,not only can the vibration modes be very different,but the amplitudes can also differ considerably.For example,at a specific bearing,the horizontal vibration may be 6.0 mils,whereas its vertical vibration may be almost zero.All vibration data in the diagrams are at the frequency of 1 x rpm. Vertical vs.Horizontal Vibration The platform vibrates around a horizontal axis,therefore there is a higher amplitude of vibration as you move away from the center of the platform.Rotational vibration is a combination of vertical and horizontal forces that combine to give a vibration effect.What are the Shock and Vibration From Table 3,the contribution of the measuring point 11 on the vibration of medium speed mill in three directions was great,and the vertical vibration of medium speed mill also should be tested.Therefore,the measuring points 2,6,11,and 12 were chosen as the final scheme of OSP.
