Next generation coal gasification technology Canadian Clean. and sequestration (CCS),are at an advanced stage of planning.Various coal gasification technologies are embodied in these plants including different coal feed systems (dry or slurry),fireproof interiors walls (fire brick or water cooled tubes),oxidants (oxygen or air),and other factors.Many of these designs are now several&nbsp;. Different Types of Gasifiers and Their Integration with Gas Turbines Consequently,most entrained flow gasifiers use oxygen rather than air and operate above the slagging temperature of the coal.Generic.Slurry fed feed systems have a lower capital cost,but result in less efficient conversion of coal to syngas (referred to as the “cold gas efficiency” of the gasifier).This is because some of&nbsp;.
