Extraction of Tantalum from locally sourced Tantalite using. ABSTRACT: The ability of polyethylene glycol solution to extract tantalum from locally sourced tantalite ore was studied.The amount of.of the ground ore was ball milled at an hourly interval of 2,4,6 using medium ball mills.Such a plot is very useful,since at each point it directly displays the concentration in both phase. Economic Geology of Niobium and Tantalum Walter L.Pohl Note that because of facile overgrinding,metallurgical recovery of columbite by crushing and milling hard rock ore is often as low as 50%.Tantalum is silvery grey,heavy and very hard but malleable and ductile.It has a high melting point exceeded only by tungsten and rhenium.Tantalum alloys with other elements have&nbsp;.
