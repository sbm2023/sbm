sbm breccia pendulum millEarthquakes and Other Earth Movements,by John Milne A. To make a pendulum perfect it therefore requires some compensating 26 arrangement,so that the pendulum,for small displacements,shall be in neutral equilibrium,and the errors due to swinging shall be avoided.Several methods have been suggested fo Encyclopedia of Fantasy (1997) All entries: 4129 This digital version of the Encyclopedia of Fantasy (1997) edited by John Clute and John Grant was prepared by David Langford in 1999 and placed online in October 201 Ch.8 Breccia also has large fragments of rock.Conglomerate is a clastic sedimentary rock composed of rounded fragments of rocks and rock particles that have been lithified.Breccia is usually formed closer geographically to the point of origin of the rock fragments than are the rock fragments in conglomerate.
