A discussion on the measurement of grinding media wear. Although there is some divergence regarding cost composition,the literature is unanimous in reporting that comminution may represent the highest cost in mining:.A survey found out that approximately 53% of the grinding circuits around the world use ball mills,and 38% use autogenous or semi autogenous grinding,and&nbsp;.
