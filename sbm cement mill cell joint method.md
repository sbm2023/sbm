PMMA bone cements are primarily used for the fixation of joint prostheses.In the fixation of joint replacement the self curing cement fills the free space between the prosthesis and the bone,and constitutes a very important interface ().Due to their optimum elasticity,the bone cements can evenly cushion the forces acting against the bone.

Ball mill The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement,silicates,refractory material,fertilizer,glass ceramics,etc.as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and non ferrous metals.The ball mill can grind various ores and other materials either wet or dry. Cement Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry,or with sand and gravel,produces concrete.Cement is the most widely used material in existence and is only behind water as the planet's most consumed resource.
