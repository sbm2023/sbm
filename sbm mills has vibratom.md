Grinding Mill Types,Construction,and Usage Grinding Mills. The vibration can be generated by springs,electromagnets,air cushions or unbalanced mass.These mills also have application in fine (45 microns) grinding.High energy vibration mills can grind materials to surface areas of around 500m2 g,a degree of fineness,which is impossible in a conventional mill (Russell,1989). Study on dynamic response and vibration reduction of medium. This is one of the primary vibration sources in the deaeration coal bunker of the primary plant.There have been few researches on the vibrations in the foundations and plants caused by medium speed mills,but some researchers have investigated vibration characteristics of similar dynamic machines.Gazetas proposed&nbsp;. relations between pulverizing process parameters and beater wheel.
