AUTOGENOUS MILL FEED PREPARATION TO REDUCE UNIT … AUTOGENOUS MILL FEED PREPARATION TO REDUCE UNIT ENERGY CONSUMPTION ABSTRACT The through put and energy efficiency of an autogenous (AG) grinding mill are adversely affected by variability in rock size and rock competency.This applies to both fully autogenous and semi autogenous (SAG) grinding circuits. Mill (grinding) A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water (). Pulverizer Capacity is not simply “tons throughput per hour!” varies with mill types but are also largely influenced by coal feed rate,HGI variations,spring pressures,coal fineness,mechanical alignment of the grinding elements,bearing condition,optimum or reduced air fuel ratios,etc.Our experience proves that mo Consumption of Coal and lignite World Coal consumption.
