Must know: The cost elements of cement Market Realist 15 Aug 2014.Different varieties of fuel—diesel,coal,pet coke,and lignite—are used to grind the clinker in the kiln.Cement plants require different amounts of power based on the heat treatment process that&#39;s being used.Energy consumption hovers around 60 70 kilowatt hours (or kWh) of power per pound of clinker&nbsp;. Energy Efficiency Improvement and Cost Saving. Energy Star consumption and raw material calcination dropped 24%,from 610 lb C ton of cement (0.31.tC tonne) to 469 lb C ton cement (0.23 tC tonne).Despite the historic progress,there is ample room for energy efficiency improvement.The share of wet process plants decreased from 60% in 1970 to about 7% of clinker production. cement case study OECD.org The wet process is being phased out in many developing countries (Price et.al.1999) and is rarely used for new plants.Many different types of cement are produced,varying in,for example,strength and setting (hardening) time.Differing proportions of clinker and other additives in the final product cause these variations.
