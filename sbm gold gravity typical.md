Extracting gold from gravity concentrates using grinding and sieving. 7 Jan 2016.This primary concentrate is then upgraded using smaller scale gravity based clean up equipment.Yukon miners typically do not sell concentrates until they are greater than 70 wt% gold,and as primary concentrates rarely exceed 1 wt%,the upgrading machines play an essential part in gold production. Specific Gravity Test : Gold Nuggets For Sale Buy Gold Nuggets. A Specific Gravity Test is used to calculate the amount of gold contained in a gold nugget that contains a mixture of gold and quartz.The test only works for gold in quartz and will not work for gold in other matrix materials.You need two pieces of information to do the calculation.You need the weight of the specimen in air&nbsp;. specific gravity test for gold nuggets Gold Nuggets Resource In this example of the specific gravity test,we use gold mixed with quartz.Nugget weighed in air weighs 96 grams.Nugget suspended in water weighs 74.5 grams.96 74.5 = 23.5 96 divided by 23.5 = 4.17 (the specific gravity of the specimen) 4.17 2.63 (the average specific gravity of quartz) = 1.54 1.54 x 23.5 = 36.19.
