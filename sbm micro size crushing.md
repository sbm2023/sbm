Basic Comminution Concepts and Recent Trends in the Industry. Crushing reduces the particle size of run of mine ore to such a level that grinding mill can further grind it until the mineral and gangue is substantially.Some evidence has also been reported for downstream benefits such as reduced grinding strength and improved leachability due to micro cracking (Knecht,1994).
