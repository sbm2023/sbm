Generating Electricity from Coal Duke Energy has been using coal to produce electricity in the Carolinas since 1911.Those first coal fired plants (in Greensboro,N.C.and Greenville,S.C.) only supplemented the company’s use of hydroelectricity.In the 1920s,the growing demand for electricity began to outstrip the availability of hydroelectric generation. The Roles of Coal and Coke in Steelmaking &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Coke and coal are not required during this process,as it uses electricity instead.Coke is often produced away from the steel mills,and is often delivered via railway.It is the job of rotary railcar dumpers made by Heyl &amp; Patterson to get the coke quickly and safely out of the car and deposited at the steel mill. Coal Mill Coal ball mill is a machine that crushes and grinds the coal briquette into pulverized coal It is important auxiliary equipment of pulverized coal furnace During the coal grinding process,the coal is crushed and its superficial area increases continually To add new superficial area,the bond between solid molecules must be overcome,so the energy is consumed The coal is grinded into.
