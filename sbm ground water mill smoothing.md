Parham (2005a) criticises Hancock's analysis arguing that the failure to find statistically significant results reflects short term noise in the data,and that it is better to focus on smoothed data.If the ABS analysis of productivity cycles is accepted,it seems most natural to focus on a data set consisting of such cycles,as is done in most of the informal discussion of the topic. Drastic A Standardized System For Evaluating Groundwater. Ground water movement is restricted to the interflow zones formed between lava flows.For this type of basalt,the user would assign a rating of 2 to the media because the pollution potential is low.However,in other areas of the plateau,the basalts are comprised of thin lava flows with extensive fracturing and jointing,permeable interflow.
