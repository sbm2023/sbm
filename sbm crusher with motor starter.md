The Difference Between a Soft Starter and a Var. element14. 12 Aug 2016.A soft starter is a solid state device that protects AC electric motors from damage caused by sudden influxes of power by limiting the large initial inrush.They can maintain speed of equipment,making them ideal for manufacturing equipment and industrial equipment such as mixers,grinders,and crushers. VSD or Soft starter for Stone Crushing Machine Motors It is not required all the time this motors are the short time duty cycle,so Soft starter only limit the starting current to motor.The torque.for which motor is designed VSDs are less efficient than soft starters,so cost more to run (3% versus 0.5% losses).Generally speed variation is not necessary for crushers.* Power of drive&nbsp;. MKS Anlasser und Elektrotechnik Liquid starter and drive.
