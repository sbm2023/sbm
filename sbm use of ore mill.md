Iron and steel industry in the United States Code Slogo.There were about 112 minimills or specialty mills in the US,which in 2013 produced 59% of US total steel production.The specialty mills use iron and steel scrap,rather than iron ore,as feedstock,and melt the scrap in electric furnaces. Frequently Asked Questions The mill mounts take up 1.5 inches of bar space,and the mill must be mounted &#189;” away from the power head.This means that you will lose effectively 2 inches of bar space with a G777 (one mount) and 4 inches of bar space with any of the G778 models (two mounts). Chilean Mill The Chilean Mill consists essentially of four heavy cast iron rollers with convex surfaces which are rotated on a concave surfaced die ring.The purpose of this design is to keep the ore between the crushing surfaces at all times,thus avoiding the necessity of scrapers to direct the ore into the crushing areas,and also to avoid spillage.
