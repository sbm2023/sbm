Copper Ore Types: Sulfides vs.Oxides Investing News Network 20 Apr 2017.However,in some cases low grade copper oxide ores can still be economically mined because they can be processed at a lower cost than copper sulfide ores.These copper oxide ores are usually leached using sulfuric acid to liberate the copper minerals into a solution of sulfuric acid laden with copper&nbsp;. Kinetics of leaching of covellite in ferric sulfate sulfuric acid media. 24 Aug 2015.The leaching temperature was varied from 20° to 90°C,the total iron concentration varied from 0.1 mol L to 0.5 mol L,the Fe+³ Fe+² ratios varied from 0.1 to 10.The leaching results showed that an increase in temperature will result in an increase in the rate and extent of copper extraction.However,the&nbsp;. Copper Wikipedia Copper does not react with water,but it does slowly react with atmospheric oxygen to form a layer of brown black copper oxide which,unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air,protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation).A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper&nbsp;.
