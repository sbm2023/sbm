sbm rod mills circuitRod mills,how they function Rod mills usually require greater operator attention.It is important that the rods stay essentially parallel to one another.If rods become misaligned,grinding action is lost and,more importantly,rod tangles occur.Maximum rod length is limited to about 6.1 m (20 ft).This in turn limits the le The effects of ore blending on comminution behaviour and. is the hardest where primary rod mill grinding is concerned.This is followed by the Kiruna ore and lastly the Leve&#228;niemi ore.In secondary ball milling,it has been established that the Leve&#228;niemi ore becomes the hardest followed by the Mertainen ore and lastly the Kiruna ore.
